# PHP-WebDAV
Single file PHP WebDAV server.

-

Initial code. Bit of a 2 day hack job but it seems to work.
Tested with CyberDuck and Windows 10 Web Client service.
Just change password, dump it in your web folder and off you go.

Does not (yet) follow the RFC precisely, needs a bit of code refactor and does not do locking, but most of litmus passes.
Also, web admin console does nothing yet.
